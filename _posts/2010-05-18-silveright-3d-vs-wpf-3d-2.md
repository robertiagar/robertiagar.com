These days I've been messing around with Visual Studio 2010 Express for Windows Phone and I've noticed that the animation in the Phone List Application are pretty awesome so I've looked deeper into the bowels of the app and found out that it's made using Projections. Basically it projects something into 3D space. Pretty nice for 3D-like applications. In this blog post I will add more as I find more interesting stuff to post. So far I know that you can't project things in WPF. I'll try to find out how to do it properly in Silverlight, then try it in WPF.<br /><br />Stay tuned. More to come…
