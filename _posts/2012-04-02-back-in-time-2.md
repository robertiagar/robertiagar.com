last night i found something interesting, something that really impressed me.<br /><br />i was with her watching a movie. all of a sudden i get this weird, but nice, sensation. i was taken back a brief moment to day i finaly decided to call her and talk about us. all of the emotions that where inside of me came back, for a short, brief moment. <br /><br />i'm sure i can explain it, but there i was, standing in the laboratory of systems theory. the proffesor was talking about something related to the subject. i didn't pay that much attention. i was distracted by my own thoughts, my thoughts of her...<br /><br />all of this happened in a split second. then i came back and she was there, smiling, looking at me how she's always had. i'm lucky to have her, and even more lucky to get her back...<br /><br /><br /><br /><span class="post_sig">Posted from WordPress for Android</span>
