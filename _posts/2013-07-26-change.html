<div dir="ltr">these days I've undergoing through a few changes at work and home. at work I've been reassigned and I've changed dorms. you might think that it's not a big deal. it shouldn't be, but i came to the realization that i don't respond that well to change and that's bad...</div>
<div dir="ltr">to be honest it's not the change that's the problem. it's the adaptation.. it takes a while to adapt and when I do something else changes. is like someone badly threaded my tasks. instead of each one to run in parallel, they wait for each other. kind of a bad example, but I'd been wanting to make a thread reference for a while now. anyways I digress (hope it means what I think it means)</div>
